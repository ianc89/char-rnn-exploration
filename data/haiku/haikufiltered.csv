last red in the sky,a small girl's moon face rises,over the counter
christmas services,a cellular phone rings out,handel's messiah
Passover darkness -,before the buds burst open;,a child's eyes in death.
Last night of Summer,the bright full moon of last night,hidden by a cloud
Midnight and full moon,my neighbour asks to borrow,the vacum cleaner
yellow walnut leaves,slowly appear on the lawn--,early morning light
after its first flight,the young gerfalcon's talons,tighter on my glove
sultry afternoon,only the mailbox shadow,crosses the dirt road

Autumn mist obscures,the island in the distance,she cleans her glasses
snow mixes with rain --,my mother keeps calling me,by my brother's name
white cloud of a moon,drifting in the morning sky,these October days
This morning the geese,have taken over the skies,in wild abandon
alabaster moon ~,glowing among bare pine tops,in cool mountain mist
looking at the sky,dandelions with haircuts,"oh, that wind, that wind"
antique store window,looking at dirty street snow,through colored bottles
poetry meeting,I try to read my haiku...,a frog in my throat
Now the shore is grey,and the wind is sharp with rain.,Some day we'll sit close
"We talk in the street,",surrounded by melting snow,and mad rushing crowd
picking up his toys,still in my funeral clothes,the very last time
my dead mother's voice,on the answering machine,. . . again and again . . .
visiting the graves,stronger the October wind,at my grandparents'
On this dark grey day,my thoughts wander to a pair,of  blue irises
A bone scan today,on the way three birds on the,rose scented old path
Tonight on my deck,setting sun the longest time,bring memories back
The Budapest square --,Autumn leaves drift  here and there,on  young protestors
a break in the clouds,spider webs and plastic bags,catch the morning light
Through the  pulp mill smoke,A long red line is showing --,Start of a sunrise
Lights of the ferry --,leave the island of cedars,in deep dark shadow

Cool and cloudy day,slowly the season changes,mirrored in your eyes
middle of the night,my fingers tick tick ticking,a hot flash haiku
swarm of tiny wings,fades out in the autumn sky-,unfinished journal
harvest moon gleaners,"pale faces, leaden eyes stare",at an empty field
white roadside crosses,where the road's swale meets Nature,memento mori
he turns one last time,flashing his sailor's wry smile,that bright November.
she cries silently,her sobs barely audible,and no one to hear
rivulets of red,running down her pale young face,she clutches a doll
a flagpole stands guard,before a flooded schoolhouse,as a river runs
drawn in by the smell,of fast food and vinegar,this october sun
breakfast still rumbles,but no other guns are heard,Armistice morning.
he winds up his watch,so carefully that morning ,that will end the war
In front of bronze doors,they huddle against the cold,the newly homeless
lonely butterfly,in the quiet morning light,where are you going?
sudden thunderstorm-,open umbrellas flower,in many colors
in the nursing home,she talks about the brother,no one talks about
red poppies growing,between rows of white tombstones,as in remembrance
in an old snapshot,his Irish smile still flashes,"her slight, shy smile, too"
small green waves crashing,against a porcelain rim,morning tea tempest
My tea gets colder,and the madeleine just sinks,memory betrays

the moon is broken,Battersea Power Station,from a train window
"old, brittle, dry bones",found inside a uniform ,a past imperfect
Gazing at the moon,on a still summer's evening,feast for mosquitoes

for seconds between,flood rains: the sunny colours,of market mangoes
like scattering tacks:,the forecast record rainfall,on the bus's roof
tea in china cups,the wet afternoon perfumed,with tangerine peels
Friday the 13th --,a bit of volcanic ash,in the winter fog
A Rainy cool day,promise of Kona coffee,from Honolulu

turning seventy,i walk outside to see it,the almost full moon
Orion rises,dragging Autumn behind him,Late August morning
Patient old donkey,waiting for her morning hay,Gray August sunrise
October daisy,bedraggled but still upright,The cold morning rain
Herding a young deer,through the gate to its mother,Steady autumn rain
cut into his arm,a line for each day between,Christmas and New Year
crackling in the air¬ñ,on a frigid afternoon,tea and ginger snaps
A young deer peering,at me around the hedgerow,"Then, the silent leap"
a wide open bay ,as far as the eye can see ,the herring gull's call
Withering daisies,Brittle petals littering,the dusty pasture
Flank to the sunrise,Old donkey taking winter,one day at a time
scattered in the ditch ,like tiny scraps of blue sky,bits of plastic bag
profound blue of night ,the resin and salt of pines,so far from the sea
kissing the widow,along her silver neck chain,the glint of his ring
nude in the sauna,the young woman pours water,on stony silence
thunderstorm downpour,thrashing against the window,her sweat on my lips
When my time is done,remember I saw swallows,taking their first flight
orgies are best left,to the hobbits elves and dwarfs,imaginary
kiss me back to home,if my attempt to escape,makes me a forlorn
green economics,a man dressed in green rides the,bear financial bull
rough stone smooth stone - both,born from the same mountain - but,one has suffered much
ere swallows dare come,march's ranging breezes stir,dancing daffodils
read the lunation,what it says about winter,then perfect the step
the crayoned rainbow,got swallowed by her sea bed,sinking deep inside
twelfth day of christmas,among twelve drummers drumming,was one little boy
he peeks through windows,for socks of dreaming children,to give them surprise
the church bells resound,dulcet choirs kill drowsiness,lights dispel darkness
cakes chocos candies,truffles tarts cookies dumplings,desserts nuts and fruits
turkey chicken duck,sausages ham bacon pie,sizzle on salvers
invite friends and foes,be a visitor yourself,spread love and be loved
rockets of blind faith,sputter and crackle dead dreams,like time bleeding stars
through soft painted moans,a man watches his life drown,in waves of glass bones
through bright haunted smiles,a woman hums white magic,sings pain into pearls
reflections of self,in multiple dimensions,whirl across the sky
throbbing blue rhythms,a torn heart wrestles naked,with wounds from the past
black holes coalesce,into mounds of burned feathers,and crucified trust
between death and hell,a bridge shining silver wings,offers his soul hope
that good gardener,who wept thorns plowing his fields,harvests grace with joy
here is the timeless,mystery that pays no heed,to death's greedy pride
songs of hearts divine,mortal angelic holy,billow starlit wings
here are lips of flame,eager to be extinguished,by love's liquid sigh
stars wishing upon,the potential of humans,shine faithfully on
collect red bug bites,show you a peacock before,his tail gets ratty
and fills the lost ring's,hollow with life's most lasting,part cries for new love
if not for the cat,and the scarcity of cheese,i could be content
do we seem rootless,holding fast to the anchor,of the saddest things
northern follows jig,body flashes with strike dive,broken line floats up
i burned with love in,empty rooms i sternly turned,knives within myself
but nothing could kill,a faith like a guillotine,as heavy as light
into the heavens,flew a breathless legion of,impossible crows
making jazz swing in,seventeen syllables ain't,no square poet's job
'tis all gold and snow,save where scarlet waves are hurled,down yon gulf below
of the days of eld,preserve the freedom only,not the deeds of blood
my life is little,only a cup of water,but pure and limpid
the underground roads,are as the dead prefer them,always tortuous
softly wordlessly,shadow and light coalesce,emergent being
silence of the dawn,sailing in sun speckled sea,gliding into port
profound stillness clouds,and trees collect on the pond,which way up which down
trees reach to the clouds,golden leaves on branches fall,natures cathedral
reaching for the stars,copper gold gifts soon will fall,then the tree can sleep
snow lands on hemlocks,gentle as falling feathers,turning needles white
tango with shadows,each on its own axis spins,dialogue of light
gently from the sky,landing like a sacrament,level and divine
shadow and pollen,atop mauve crocus petals,bespeak winter's end
light worships surface,gently unlocking colour,and stepping inside
rain in the morning,soft beginning of the day,inviting stillness
dying of the leaves,forest of changing colours,silence of the trees
yellow butterflies,look like flowers flying through,the warm summer air
at sunset we sat,you and me quietly there,breathing in and out
between teeth and tongue,red planet bursting luscious,supernova sweet
still part of the whole,or already forgotten,without a meaning
silent day breaking,saffron yolk of light running,pushing the shadows
shedding energy,small birdquake oscillating,resonating light
once more as i wait,for you night and icy wind,melt into cold rain
my thoughts are resting,on colourful blossoms yet,free like butterflies
how i do love thee,oh virtuous untamed lawn,sweet and unfettered
perhaps this silent,wanderer fashions flowers,dreamy butterfly
deep in the dark woods,murk in my mind vanished by,this light from above
all of the buses,safely hidden till the fall,yellow chariots
when time is over,will anybody recall,that there once was more
it has come to pass,all that is mortal is lost,sometime anywhere
to find the beauty,even if it's dark and grey,that lightens my day
there must be some good,hidden amidst all the bad,know i will find it
without just one nest,a bird can call the world home,life is your career
summer suspended,warm buzzing tempest laid flat,reliquery sun
my mother told me,that a yellow sunset means,hard wind is coming
long shadows at noon,means winter and sun cold day,of peaceful walking
clouds hang on bare trees,but the snow on the mountains,is a white blessing
can you see the ray,if you can see it you will,soon find your true love
sourwood racemes,flowers just a memory,autumnal pendants
aperture golden,bundle of rays traversing,instrument of light
moon is a whole note,cloudy stanzas span blue sky,staccato geese soar
doves in the morning,love flowering on a branch,beautiful bouquet
a turn done in air,the sprightly red dancer bounds,a dance without plot
spinning wheel of hearts,love at the ends of petals,unfolding brightly
horizon slanting,the grey sea of winter is,paved in iced glass tiles
from the tops of trees,red cardinals will alight,in the dormant grass
out of cold thin air,brilliant carmine leaves will form,on dormant branches
which one is tallest,the nearest or the farthest,but both in my mind
riverbed secrets,yielding fragmental colours,pop and beer bottles
like a summer breeze,blue sky landing in my heart,a cloud with feathers
slung between branches,radiating summer sun,the winter hammock
the morning sunrise,so beautiful to behold,glowing breath of light
corner of my eye,perception is blurry line,between truth and lie
happy to be here,sparrow says good morning day,in the golden light
tears fall like silence,haiku hanging from a branch,words are descending
my quizzical too,bluest bluet brusquely bluffs,bully on a branch
rest your weary feet,comfy place to sit and eat,the squirrel settle
sea spray's frothy lace,waves sweeping sandy edges,#NAME?
i'm so sweet on him,bright red flash on dormant grass,i call him my crush
alchemy of light,turning moments into gold,everywhere i look
how you eye me so,inclined on a branch steeply,homage picasso
cupid's arrow darts,love often feels like a blur,red heart with feathers
round and red and warm,sunshine for a cold monday,bright scarlet engine
perching on one foot,i'm a little icicle,on a winter branch
dawn and dusk cycle,another tree has fallen,now rests silently
a building's dark heart,bleeds grime decay from it's seams,the city's mirror
yellow hammering,audible beacon tapping,visible morse code
a stream of my thoughts,washing over my short life,the sound renews me
my empty strumming,overtaken by the storm,fading memories
you can't fence him in,rebel in a shark skin suit,he's blue greased lightning
shadows of my life,walking closer or away,i'm still no closer
resting here to sing,tiny graces of the wind,trills pierce leaden air
buttons and bellows,a box full of singing reeds,the concertina
in the summer heat,like hot coals under your feet,where sun and sand meet
in sowing questions,for which there are no answers,she's finding her peace
got just a dusting,snow heavier south of here,it's still very cold
stranger to england,fragile fugitive fingers,reaching for the sun
colourful music,temporal variations,my reflected theme
penitent petal,not quite finished unfurling,awaits sun's blessing
no pole no paddle,it doesn't really matter,just go with the flow
as if by magic,sun and rain and rain again,and a pearl of light
in the way that we,without even noticing,complete each other
a shameless blue heart,glows in the jade summer woods,draped with muslin wings
after the flower,and before the fruit red gems,on a green background
oh how small my sweet,is your painted parasol,in this intense heat
sweet lipstick kisses,left by the sun on beaches,at the end of day
deep in the darkness,fly all things that we most fear,lose them in the light
searching for blue sky,navigating by the stars,sometimes it finds you
concrete atlantus,tried to sail the seven seas,but sank just offshore
a blue note resting,in a line of green music,sweet and clear and high
i have seen the world,spread below me like a quilt,confident of air
through a glass darkly,we see a poor reflection,of the other side
silence afforded,only from throbbing numbness,no longer feeling
so many seeds red,and juicy dripping staining,a rainy autumn
contrast loving child,born of daylight and of night,at their edges stirs
fog has descended,muting the pines' green needles,at november's end
wasting not a thing,life puts pears in strawberries,mysteries unfold
no horizon: light,as a line down to the side,of the winter sea
guess where dear the sea,is green even in winter,mirrored by my eyes
the size of a dime,blending in is his strong suit,animated rock
an object light skin,wearing the august sun as,a silver garland
dancing on water,in shimmering summer shades,we swim through the sky
maple lights in wood,like stars of natures heaven,nourishing the earth
autumn sunrays shine,on forest trees soon to sleep,coloured shadows weep
night sunset in wales,ancestors of this landscape,gazed upon this scene
walk lime avenue,where golden autumn stars shine,and fall on the earth
the snow white angels,out of the shadows they glide,perfect harmony
white wings of angel,floating in the autumn sky,seagull softly fly
rust and red magic,lit by nature's autumn sun,tall trees protecting
sinking of the sun,sunlight sparkles on the lake,before black night comes
sunset on the hill,lights the end of autumn day,with glowing sunrays
before the red gate,only one choice to be made,enter or escape
the power lines stretched,across the kingdom of frost,north of all music
swans rest together,in the evening star sunset,until darkness falls
shadows and sunset,spirits of coal ships sail here,in new cardiff bay
always remember,you will never be alone,when you have a friend
darkness has a light,when we look through the shadows,for love we may seek
white barn owl i held,heart shaped face and beautiful,looked at me with peace
eyes of golden light,face with dreamlike majesty,hidden voice within
look of pride in eyes,beautiful kestrel has the,colours of rainbow
in the morning snow,beauty stands  so motionless,black as ebony
no bunch of flowers,only this magnolia bud,i do not forget
a skein of seven,silent sandhills overhead,an ancient journey
dragonfly so blue,just rests on a rock in pond,it will never fly
by the jetty waits,a silver boat for sailing,on water so blue
winter frozen lakes,supporting a frozen snake,motionless swimming
earth frozen with ice,snow covered in winters cold,ponies on the hill
i walked the long path,to the ancient cathedral,and my soul found peace
light shone from the hill,in this place of such beauty,shades of blues and greens
village pond of old,reflection of ancient farm,mirrored on the sky
spreading tentacles,mimic the colour of dreams,rocked in tidal sway
clouds at sunset time,hide the dying gold sun rays,shine as magic lights
tardis rise from sea,copper roof now shining gold,space like sentinel
born in raging wind,lashed with icy rain on hill,beautiful today
heaven meets the earth,sky blue with white clouds sailing,jewelled with silver
memories so pure,life that was so beautiful,colours of sunset
only the one now,hold on tight and remember,protect and cherish
green is the colour,silent tree music plays here,time to stop and stare
view across the vale,as far as the eye can see,yellow on yellow
under azure sky,a small child stands on the stones,ancient abbey stones
maytime bluebell time,sapphire stars of perfume,painted on welsh hills
past years reflected,in these cold canal waters,for nine hundred years
in evening's last light,a golden yellow lily,gleams a warm good night
like a ship sailing,on the sea to distant lands,looking out on bay
here on golden pond,sunset glows as shining stars,glittering like pearls
billowing softly,sheets on summer lines drying,the laundress winds blow
here they come for peace,blessing from the holy pope,spiritual love
rising from the earth,space like vision of beauty,treasure of plantlife
a perchance to dream,hear singing of the sea birds,boats bobbing on tide
out of summer air,with gold and black magic rings,came this dragonfly
path down to sand beach,wild welsh winds seals and dolphins,place of harmony
place of pilgrimage,church of the sea and the wind,resting quietly
magical moments,wishes do come true for you,when you wait awhile
ponies on the sand,summer evenings will soon end,racing to the sea
sunlight fading fast,seagulls resting on the sands,time for going home
summer becomes fall,hot earth breathes sighs of relief,flowers set their seeds
are you sure that eve,in the garden offered one,small apple only
on the sea shore line,walking under setting sun,shadows of people
only the gold sun,setting over the welsh sea,shimmering like silk
light on the mountains,shadows in the green valleys,grey clouds in the sky
only natures sounds,the cries of curlews and sheep,echoes of silence
grey clouds in the sky,silver blue waters in pool,shadows reflecting
lake of magic tales,light of heaven shining here,with soft autumn shades
green gold autumn hues,shadows long with sun so low,distant sea and sky
in this autumn morn,rusty reflections of trees,gliding of the swans
bright lights in the wood,shimmering in the shadows,leaves of maple tree
copper medals shine,natures prizes for beauty,in magic beech leaves
my thoughts were dancing,over the cloud dappled lake,of magic colours
these are not plain leaves,these are colourful plane leaves,above the plane leaves
trees of rich colours,magical paradise view,apollos temple
by a cross of stone,guarding this ancient vast place,play young lives of now
restless clouds dancing,copper and jade trees sailing,mirror of the lake
golden waters still,autumn leaves fading away,glimpse of mallard ducks
dark shadows shining,shadows of gold and green shades,shadows of trees glow
on cold gusty winds,that tall trees sway and dance to,wintertime arrives
end of the old year,renewal of clock of time,fading of the past
golden eyes to stare,jet black like the darkest night,king of his domain
wild ponies of wales,ancestors of the high hills,rooted in this place
stillness in the air,snow carpeting the green fields,grey light shines from sky
tall trees give shelter,in wind  rain and icy snow,guiding and guarding
on snowy hill top,the shepherd watches his sheep,thinking and dreaming
welsh flags are flying,on caerphilly castle walls,in the winters snow
walking on the path,by snow covered welsh castle,a lady in red
the old oak tree stands,protecting and sheltering,with its outstretched arms
snow blankets the ridge,below billowing white clouds,sunlight and shadows
low sunrays shining,golden sunset magic time,long winter shadows
end of winters day,sun dying over the sea,golden memories
sheep speckled mountain,people treading the old paths,welsh black cattle graze
icy welsh mountain,speckles on the high summit,just men and giants
rocks and sand and sea,pools of icy cold water,winter memories
sleeping trees waken,now lit with soft leaves of light,warming  the cold woods
snow topped hills of wales,sheep grazing on the steep slopes,land of poetry
celebrate easter,resurrection from the earth,the gifts of new life
silver dancer sways,slender branches blow in wind,sacred tree of old
canal cottage walls,heavy hooves on the tow path,boat of bright colours
snow covers the floor,no roof to protect from storms,shelter from stone walls
for two hundred years,horseshoe pass road twists and bends,hanging on mountain
facing the mountains,southwards to the sun and sea,bodnant in beauty
stone walls stand guarding,the old town of caernarfon,castle of beauty
slate quarries now gone,cottage sleeping in the past,mountain memories
windows on the world,past lives decayed in the past,locked still in the stones
in serene silence,where buzzards soar in the sky,the white summer house
twisting road through pass,mists of secret ancient times,mountains of giants
reaching to the sky,beauty in its silent grace,protecting the graves
seats to watch over,the precious sleeping children,with love and beauty
first bluebells are here,rain and cold winds blow down on,scented sapphires
new foal of pure gold,spirit of the high mountains,so wild and carefree
spirited ponies,breathe the welsh air of heaven,peaceful in silence
watching the ponies,standing in the warm sunshine,moments of beauty
green pastures of wales,rolling down to blue waters,just bleating of sheep
glowing garden glens,glimmering green galleries,give gentle glances
reaching to heaven,clouds of white billowing mists,so far yet so near
free as bird that flies,where mountain peaks are so high,valleys  lakes and sea
blue sky whispy clouds,sea serene and shimmering,evening by the sea
necks arched in repose,stillness in the silent air,swan song of beauty
feathers of soft silk,colours of clouds in the sky,silence of the swans
sea waves silvery,jurrassic cliffs of old rock,treasures of the coast
by box pond foxgloves,light up shadows in the woods,trees softly whisper
come and walk with me,on bridge of tranquillity,and perfumed flowers
meet at the arbour,looking over green woodlands,to distant landscape
colour of deep calm,colour of life on this earth,colour of leaf birth
silver sea soft sky,screech of seagulls special sounds,ponies in the surf
seagulls are calling,sea waves crash in the distance,ponies cantering
evening light now falls,seagulls resting on the shore,ponies going home
a magical scene,dragonfly in summer sun,in an insect world
on silvery lake,the dancing clouds race in skies,where welsh hills do roam
colourful vistas,an english country garden,in all its glory
penclawdd at day end,golden light fading on sea,marsh grasses hidden
a black and white colt,sat beniethu00a0 blue skies and clouds,enjoying his day
he appeared scrappy,with one eye and rugged frame,wearing rust suits him
so small she was when,i planted her in the sun,to make evening shade
its called a gods sky,when sun rays escape through clouds,as if from heaven
when shadows begin,to eat the light at sunset,darkness will swallow
color sky days blue,when big cotton candy clouds,make shapes in the sky
such a handy bridge,for crossing tiny puddles,of left over rain
he knows his job well,collecting the mice and moles,in house and garden
her walls still hold on,to years of being a home,refusing to fall
if not for the tree,standing alone in a field,there would be no shade
if you want a prince,kiss a slimy frog like this,the story book said
sometimes i enjoy,a slow ride home the back way,wind blowing my hair
the sound of tadpoles,singing that late winter day,cured my winter blues
she put a long tub,in the rose bed for herself,to soak at sunset
shadows fall around,announcing a cloudy day,the sun is hiding
the barn seems lonesome,without the house beside him,soon he too will fall
i listen to wind,as it howls and bends the trees,whispering winter
just before darkness,fireflies rise from the ground,as day bids farewell
solar lights turn on,birds in tree tops are chatting,as day bids farewell
the tin roof and rain,seem to play a pleasant song,in perfect rhythem
she spends time peeping,looking out windows and doors,watching the neighbors
i wanted to squash,the frog eating dragonflies,that blue june morning
sunrise or sunset,the two are the same as one,both do a light show
the old rusted truck,still wants to run in spite of,snow ice slush and sleet
the old train car seemed,to be announcing that yes,red suits a caboose
i took time today,to watch the sun slowly fall,into dark of night
moss speaks in colors,touch of green says winters time,will soon be ending
the sky went crazy,blue and white mixed together,like a bowl of soup
the snowman held on,getting smaller and smaller,refusing to melt
late night morning light,holds on to darkness slowly,swallowed by the sun
a tattered old barn,sits in the valleyu00a0 below,his time is not done
god never tires,of the little oops in life,he loves to smile down
old cat is tired,three fat moles he left today,next to my shovel
they passed a law that,barns not advertise smoking,so tell them goodbye
on warm moonlit nights,we turn on his radio,and bring him to life
pine trees collected,as much snow as they could hold,awaiting sunset
she built her nest low,on a split rail fence of grapes,tucked under the leaves
do her walls still hold,the laughter and chatter of,long ago children
it still dont seem right,seven old men with a girl,who does all the chores
orions only,constellation i can find,rest are all just stars
yellows the only,primary color not here,it must be elsewhere
classy graffiti,ann arbor boasts old masters,in downtown alleys
orange doors: too good,to transform to usual,black and white image
can women eat here,not according to the sign,photo may be cropped
some see black and white,some see many shades of gray,a few see color
in my mind the whole,state of new mexico looks,exactly like this
i would walk these stairs,just for the joy of color,and the rainbows end
what must sea ones think,to see the strange lights drop down,into their dark world
radiating lights,a lineup of containers,holding who knows what
a crossing of lights,a pair of bold bright colors,does x mark the spot
strange to know what lies,between the dates on the stone,is a persons life
scroll work softens bars,allows the art element,to rise and endure
squiggle graffiti,on a concrete block sidewall,says it all and more
will any name work,for this fragile piece of art,call it beautiful
caught in the quiet,and supreme understanding,of a holy place
inviting oval,metal fringes like real leaves,respond to the wind
sunshades and water,the perfect mix for a day,of lounging around
not coincidence,the mating of old and new,someones planned design
what lies behind each,of these three doors can you guess,mysteries abound
alien in scope,never judge a flower by,its unopened phase
small glass squares shivered,in winters wind casting their,colors to the ground
like the oceans waves,intricacies of past times,surge and then are gone
a thing of the past,fine transoms above doorways,to let the wind speak
ah shadows evoke,a more fascinating look,than the real object
how do lines hold up,all that exquisite fine weight,it must be balance
blue wall closed window,curtains drawn against the heat,someone is sleeping
all those glaring lights,and many still choose darkness,including the stars
daylight meets lamplight,one starts where the other fails,few notice the change
lines for making shade,looking like piano keys,metaphor for place
heaven surely waits,for one so surrounded by,a lifetime of love
valiant shrubbery,stays green even in winter,even with new snow
what catches the eye,the angle of light on stairs,shows the way to go
is g for god or,greatness goodness gratitude,generosity
nested colored bowls,do not know anxiety,do not fear breakage
alley passageway,look up for the only light,follow the bricks home
insect art color,dew ridden still evolving,what will the wind bring
new snow on a leaf,like granulated sugar,makes me want hot tea
my initial thought,like a yellow submarine,what goes on inside
mysterious marks,try to hide an outlaw kick,creating odd art
sacrificial lamb,a tiny death but one so,unforgettable
green seascape green sky,even the rock glows with green,life and storm are one
always mesmerized,by lights colors and textures,miracles appear
everything is stripped,finally to bare essence,beauty evolving
the message folded,into the shutters was the,mystery that day
eat and walk through stuff,seems a pleasant enough time,where to wipe fingers
dont you wish to know,the many things that happened,once upon a time
new earth and old earth,a trio of guardians,a stone obelisk
various colors,compliment the small towns life,always evolving
